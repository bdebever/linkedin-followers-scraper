# This tool is a simple JS script that fetches the followers of a LinkedIn company page

_How to use_

1. Change the value of ORGA_ID AND TOTAL_PAGE_FOLLOWERS at the top of the script with your number of followers on your page and the organization ID (you can get it by going to your LinkedIn admin section, eg. this URL `https://www.linkedin.com/company/{ID}/admin/analytics/followers/` )
2. Complete the value of your CSRF token and cookie, which you get by inspecting the request LinkedIn does to display your followers
